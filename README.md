- âš¡ Fun/Intresting facts: I prefer nights over days, especially when i put my headphones on, sit in front of my laptop, starting some good instrumental music and just be productive. It's thrilling and it gives me so much joy. If u can relate, high five ! :D
Also I just love coding. Since I started learning it, there is no day without it. I'm so fascinated by it and want to consantly learn.
